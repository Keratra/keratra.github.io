HOMEWORK #1
You are asked to create a basic "About Me" HTML page and style it with a bit of CSS:

1. "About Me" Page
2. Style Your Page with CSS
3. Advanced Style Techniques
4. Definition Lists for Your Favorite Movie
5. Decrementing ol

6. Create a page aboutme.html that describes you. Include information such as:
   a. Your name
   b. A brief description of you in 1-2 sentences
   c. A list of classes you are taking
   d. Your 4 favorite movies, books, games, and TV shows. Make at least one link to
   an interesting site about that favorite movie/book/game/show, such as its
   IMDB page
   e. Two images that represent when you're happy and sad
   f. Something about one of your neighbors (students sitting next to you)

7. Create a CSS style sheet named styleme.css to improve the appearance of your About
   Me page. You can find some CSS properties online. Use a <link> tag to reference your
   CSS file in your HTML.

8. Advanced Style Techniques: Try to figure out how to add the following styles:
   a. Make your hyperlinks not underlined by default. However, when a user
   hovers over the link, the underline should appear
   b. Make every paragraph start with a "drop-caps"; that is, a large initial letter
   that is 1.5 times the normal paragraph font
   c. Make text for each list item alternate between two different colors

9. Look up one of the favorite movies/shows from your About Me Page on imdb.com. In
   your page, reproduce some of the film's IMDB info in a nested list under that movie's
   bullet.

10. Modify your page's Top 3 movies/shows list to be in decreasing order, from 3 down
    to 1. The list must look the same as the default ordered list format, but in reverse
    order. The only change you may make to your HTML is to switch the order of your list
    items, but otherwise all work should be done by CSS
